"""Turn committed VAE chunks into MP4 bytes without materializing the video.

The producer side is the model's business: a Wan VAE walks a causal
frame-by-frame loop, a MiniMax-H3 VAE walks overlapping clips, and Wan S2V
decodes one clip per autoregressive iteration. What happens to a chunk once it
is final is not: every one of them quantizes to uint8, moves to the host once,
and lands in a bounded encoder. That consumer lives here so a model only has to
publish finished chunks -- :class:`SupportsChunkedVAEDecode` for producers that
can be driven, :class:`ChunkedVideoMP4Session` for producers that drive
themselves.

The move to the host runs as its own scheduled stage. A chunk is quantized on
the accelerator, copied without blocking into one of a fixed number of reusable
pinned host slots on a dedicated stream, and only read once its copy-completion
event has fired. The producer therefore returns to decoding while the copy is
still in flight, and the slot count bounds how many chunks can be in flight at
once.
