"""One append in flight, and what its failure owes the session.

An append is not a call: it is a task queued behind the previous append, which
may be cancelled, may find the session closed before it starts, and on any of
those paths has to give back what it reserved --- the PCM bytes it took from the
input budget, the committed audio it was going to consume, and the response it
precreated.

That compensation is the reason this is an object. The five steps of an append
all need the same eleven values, so as closures over ``_start_append`` they read
as one function with five entry points and no way to test any of them. Named
fields make the captured state explicit and the compensation a method.

The precreated response has two other owners the compensation defers to. When
the runner cancels the append on purpose (``DuplexSessionTasks.cancel_append_tasks``,
for a ``response.cancel``, a barge-in or a close), the runner ends that response
itself right after, with the cancel status the client asked for. When the
session is already closing, the close ends it. Everywhere else, the append is
the last thing that knows the response will never be filled, and it fails it.
