"""Everything one duplex session sends to its client.

Emission is the hub of the session runner: near enough every path through the
runner ends in an event, which is why this is a collaborator rather than a
module of functions. It owns three things the rest of the runner should not
have to think about --- the Realtime projection state, the epoch filter that
drops output from a superseded turn, and the domain transitions an outbound
terminal event applies to the session before it is projected.

The one thing it cannot own is what happens *after* a terminal promotes
deferred overlap audio: that re-enters the mailbox of the runner, so the
runner injects it as ``promote_deferred_overlap``.
