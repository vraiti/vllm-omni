"""Thin websocket serving for ``/v1/realtime?duplex=1``.

Everything about a duplex *session* lives inside the engine (see
``vllm_omni.entrypoints.duplex_omni``). This handler only does transport:

* accept the socket and run the Realtime handshake (``session.update`` opens a
  session through ``DuplexOmni.open_session``; ``session.resume`` re-attaches
  to an existing one);
* translate each client JSON event into a ``DuplexCommand`` and submit it in
  arrival order;
* pump the session's typed events to the wire, journaling them for resume;
* manage attachments: resume tokens, replay, takeover, detach on disconnect.
