"""Generic paging mechanics + chunk-window eviction spec for the AR-Diffusion engine.

Engine-generic, model-agnostic primitives — the layer a second model (e.g. the
Cosmos port) reuses unchanged. Three concerns live here:

* **Slot mapping** — absolute token positions → physical KV-cache slots, the
  standard PagedAttention layout ``slot(pos) = block_id(pos) * block_size +
  (pos % block_size)``.
* **Pool I/O** — allocate per-layer FlashAttention-compatible paged K/V pools
  plus flat compatibility views for direct slot writes.
* **Chunk-window eviction** — a ``SlidingWindowSpec`` subclass whose unit is a
  *chunk* (``sliding_window = window_chunks * chunk_size``) plus a manager that
  evicts at chunk boundaries. Memory policy / refcounting / ``null_block``
  replacement stay in vLLM's ``BlockPool``; only the token-skip math is here.
