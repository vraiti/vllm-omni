"""Native paged-KV window for MiniCPM-o 4.5 duplex Stage 0.

``window_plan.py`` holds the window arithmetic in plain integers; this file
holds the three things that need an engine: the KV-cache spec/manager pair the
scheduler resolves, the layer change that produces that spec, and the in-place
re-RoPE that follows a trim.

One mechanism, matching the reference implementation
----------------------------------------------------
A trim and a renumber are the same event here, which is what MiniCPM's HF
implementation does: cut the cached K/V, re-RoPE the survivors onto dense
positions. #7631 gets the same observable state from the other direction, by
rebuilding the prompt and letting the model recompute every retained row -- a
full forward pass over the window, per roll.

Here the cut is a block-table edit and the re-RoPE is one rotation per retained
key, because :class:`~vllm_omni.model_executor.models.minicpmo_4_5.duplex.window_plan.PositionReanchor`
guarantees the shift is one uniform translation of a whole number of pages. Two
consequences are worth stating plainly:

* No physical row moves. After ``del table[sink:sink + n]``, logical index ``j``
  resolves to the page that ``j + n`` named before the deletion -- which is the
  page the row is already in -- and a block-aligned shift leaves ``pos %
  block_size`` alone. So the rotation reads and writes the same slots, and V is
  not touched at all, because only K carries a RoPE phase.
* The window needs no mask, because there is nothing to skip: the retained span
  is contiguous and plain causal attention over it is what the model was trained
  to do. See ``window_plan.py`` for why a *masked* window cannot express a duplex
  session, and why R-SWA -- the one upstream type that can -- is not usable on a
  FlashAttention-3 Stage 0.

What the sliding-window spec is then for is sizing. ``SlidingWindowSpec`` is the
only attention type in vLLM whose ``max_admission_blocks_per_request`` bounds a
request at its window rather than at ``max_model_len``, which is what lets
``max_sessions`` concurrent streams share a Stage 0 that advertises a 40k-token
context. Its own eviction is overridden to stay inert: a masked free and a
compaction must not race for the same pages, so the gap is freed by
:meth:`MiniCPMO45DuplexWindowManager.reanchor_block_table` and nothing else.

Reuse, not reimplementation
---------------------------
The base of everything below is the repo's own
:class:`~vllm_omni.experimental.ar_diffusion.kv_cache.paged.ChunkWindowSpec` /
:class:`~vllm_omni.experimental.ar_diffusion.kv_cache.paged.ChunkWindowManager`,
which already keeps a sink, already evicts on chunk boundaries, and already
compacts a block table. This project sets ``chunk_size`` to the cache block size,
so "chunk-aligned" and "page-aligned" are the same statement and the inherited
:meth:`compact_block_table` indexing applies as written.

Two constraints come with this
------------------------------
*Prefix caching stays off.* Not only because a compacted table is no longer the
table the block hashes were computed against, but because duplex appends are
prompts of ``[filler_id] * token_budget`` (``duplex/plugin.py``) whose real
content arrives as worker-side ``inputs_embeds``: the hashes would be identical
across sessions while the KV behind them is not. ``OmniTensorPrefixCache`` has
the same exposure through its block/slot mirroring, and it and async output
materialization are mutually exclusive anyway.
*Block size.* On CUDA, kernels typically use ``block_size == 16`` for a sliding window,
while Ascend NPU uses 128. The window geometry and compaction algorithms support any
positive block size. The conversion below reads that size back off the spec the
parent produced, so the kernel's choice -- not this module's -- is the one the
chunk arithmetic uses.

Nothing here has been executed: it needs an engine, a checkpoint and a GPU. The
arithmetic it delegates to is CPU-covered by
``tests/model_executor/models/minicpmo_4_5/duplex/test_window_plan.py``, which
also checks the RoPE identity behind :func:`rotate_cached_keys` numerically.

Wiring, in the order the pieces get used
----------------------------------------
1. Model module: import this module for its spec registration, call
   :func:`install_duplex_window_layers` on the Stage 0 backbone right after
   ``init_vllm_registered_model`` so the profiler sees the windowed spec, and run
   :func:`validate_duplex_window_install` as the startup assertion.
2. Scheduler: an append becomes an ordinary session *extension*, so
   ``_update_request_as_session`` runs instead of ``_replace_streaming_session``
   and the request's token count grows rather than restarting. Nothing else
   changes until
   :func:`~vllm_omni.model_executor.models.minicpmo_4_5.duplex.window_plan.plan_position_reanchor`
   returns a plan, which is the single place a trim -- or a
   ``context_length_exceeded`` finish -- is decided.
3. Worker: for that step, check :func:`assert_uniform_position_shift` on the
   request's real positions, call
   :meth:`MiniCPMO45DuplexWindowManager.reanchor_block_table` once, then
   :func:`rotate_cached_keys` per layer, and shift the request's positions,
   ``mrope_positions`` and ``mrope_position_delta`` in the same step so the next
   forward reads the compacted layout.
4. Deploy config: ``enable_prefix_caching`` stays false, ``block_size`` matches
   the engine's cache configuration, and the window's watermarks come from
   the model's duplex policy rather than from a scheduler constant.
