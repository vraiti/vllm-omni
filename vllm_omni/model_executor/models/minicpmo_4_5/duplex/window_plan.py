"""Position and block accounting for the MiniCPM-o 4.5 duplex KV window.

MiniCPM-o's native duplex streaming has a bounded attention budget: once a
session's context passes the window, the oldest content has to go. The HF
reference implementation does that by trimming the cached K/V tensors and
re-RoPE-ing the survivors (``slide_trigger_seconds`` / ``slide_stride_seconds``
in the streaming processor, which is a *separate* window living in the audio
CNN). This module is the same rule, in the units a paged KV cache schedules in:
tokens, blocks and watermarks.

Why trimming and renumbering are one event, not two
---------------------------------------------------
The alternative is to keep every position and only mask the out-of-window
range, which is what vLLM's sliding-window cache types do. Neither fits a
duplex session:

* ``SlidingWindowSpec`` masks a *contiguous* tail window -- the kernel is handed
  ``window_size=(W-1, 0)`` -- so it cannot keep a head prefix attended while
  dropping what sits right after it.
* ``RSWASpec`` can, that being its whole shape, but it defines its sink as
  ``num_prompt_tokens``, which for a session that grows by appends is the first
  append rather than the head context the duplex protocol preserves. It also
  needs a backend that can express the mask: FA4's ``rswa_mask_mod``, Triton or
  FlexAttention. On a FlashAttention-3 Stage 0 the branch is skipped and the
  zeroed gap blocks are attended as ordinary context.

Renumbering removes the gap outright instead. The retained span is a contiguous
``[0, prefix + window)`` range, plain causal attention over it is what the model
was trained to do, and no backend has to know a window exists. The price is one
rotation of the retained keys, which is what :class:`PositionReanchor` plans.

Everything here is pure integer arithmetic so the invariants are testable
without a GPU, a checkpoint, or a vLLM engine. ``window_kv.py`` is the vLLM
tier that consumes it.

Paged KV Retention Semantics vs. Unpaged Reference
--------------------------------------------------
In the unpaged HuggingFace reference implementation (OpenBMB MiniCPM-o 4.5), KV
tensors are dense PyTorch tensors. The reference basic window drops whole units
immediately after the exact preserved prefix length:
`retained = [0, prefix_tokens) + [unit_end, total)`.

In vLLM, KV memory is paged into physical blocks of size `block_size` (e.g. 16 or 128).
To achieve zero-copy in-place KV reuse without allocating new blocks or shifting
physical slot rows across pages:
1. The sink region is aligned up to whole blocks:
   `sink_end = cdiv(prefix_tokens, block_size) * block_size`.
2. Any tokens in `[prefix_tokens, sink_end)` reside in the physical sink block and
   remain resident in-place (up to `block_size - 1` tokens).
3. The dropped interval is `[sink_end, moved_from)`.
4. The retained tail `[moved_from, total)` is translated down by `delta = moved_from - sink_end`,
   where `delta` is an exact multiple of `block_size`.

This guarantees that physical pages in the block table require no data movement or
reallocation, at the cost of retaining up to `block_size - 1` tokens of the oldest
unit in the sink page.
