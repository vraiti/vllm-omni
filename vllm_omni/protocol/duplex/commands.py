"""The client-event vocabulary a full-duplex session accepts.

Seven of the seventeen are events OpenAI's Realtime API has no equivalent for,
because they only make sense when the model and the user can talk at the same
time: the user cuts in (``barge_in``), the client reports how much audio it
played (``playback.ack``), a turn transition is signalled locally
(``turn.signal``), input is abandoned without committing (``input.cancel``),
text is pushed into a live turn (``input.text.append``), and the session is
kept alive or closed explicitly (``session.heartbeat`` / ``session.close``).
Two more are OpenAI commands carrying duplex-only fields (Tier 2).

The remaining eight are OpenAI's, unchanged, and re-exported from
``vllm_omni.protocol.realtime.commands`` rather than redeclared --- they are
the same objects. They are re-exported so this module is the *whole*
vocabulary and a duplex consumer never has to import the Tier 1 package
directly; keeping them declared there means a GA-only consumer is still not
handed events its clients never send.

None of these carries the engine's mailbox rendering: ``payload()`` and its
channel live in ``vllm_omni.engine.duplex.commands``, because for four of the
seventeen the runner's channel is not the client event type at all.
