"""What a Realtime consumer can serve, and the session check that reads it.

``session.update`` is the one client event whose acceptance depends on who is
behind the socket. The audio formats a server can decode, and whether it can do
server-side turn detection at all, are properties of the *consumer* --- the
duplex engine, or some other runtime --- not of the protocol. The codec still
has to do the checking, because it owns the error envelope and the order the
checks run in.

:class:`RealtimeProtocolCapabilities` is how a consumer states those answers.
It is the post-#7413 form of the ``supports(turn_detection, formats)`` half of
RFC #6592's proposed ``RealtimeModelAdapter``. The other three halves of that
proposal --- building a prompt, starting a response, cancelling one --- are not
here and must not come here: for a duplex model they are already owned by
``DuplexModelPlugin`` together with ``DuplexSessionRunner``, and a second
interface over the same responsibility is exactly the fork this layer exists to
prevent.

The duplex binding of this object is
``vllm_omni.engine.duplex.realtime_commands.DUPLEX_REALTIME_CAPABILITIES``.
