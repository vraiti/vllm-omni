"""Deterministic unit tests for deadline-aligned silence continuation.

The engine-resident duplex scheduler in
``vllm_omni/engine/duplex/session/runner.py`` aligns each silence
continuation to ``submission_time_N + chunk_period`` and sleeps only the
remaining budget. These tests cover the pure deadline arithmetic and the
per-session reset semantics of the shared ``DuplexModelSessionState``
contract.
