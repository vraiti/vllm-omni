"""CPU accounting tests for the MiniCPM-o 4.5 duplex KV window planner.

Pure integer/complex math: no engine, no checkpoint, no GPU. Two claims carry
the design and each gets pinned here: a block-aligned shift leaves every retained
row in the physical slot it already occupies (so a trim moves no memory), and
rotating a cached key by ``-delta`` equals RoPE at the renumbered position (so a
trim needs no forward pass).
