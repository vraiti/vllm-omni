# Sleep Mode & ACK Protocol

vLLM-Omni’s **Sleep Mode** allows you to temporarily release most GPU memory used by a model—such as model weights and key-value (KV) caches—**without stopping the server or unloading the Docker container**.

This feature is inherited from [vLLM’s Sleep Mode](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/10/26/sleep-mode.html) and extended with the **Omni ACK Protocol** to support multi-stage pipelines and heterogeneous hardware backends (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Huawei). It is especially useful in **RLHF**, **dynamic model switching**, or **cost-saving scenarios**.

## 1. Feature Documentation

### Overview

Omni Sleep Mode provides a mechanism to "sleep" specific model stages. When a stage enters sleep, its physical VRAM is reclaimed by the system, while the process state is preserved for rapid "wake-up" without full re-initialization.

### Sleep Levels

We support two levels of hibernation to balance recovery speed and memory efficiency:

| Level | Name | Mechanism | Recovery Speed | Memory Freed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | **Weight Offloading** | Offloads weights to Host CPU RAM. | **Fast** (DMA) | Substantial |
| **Level 2** | **Full De-mapping** | Physically releases memory pages via VRAM scavenging. | **Moderate** | **Maximum** (up to 95%+) |

### Supported Platforms

Omni Sleep Mode is optimized for high-performance computing backends:

* **NVIDIA**: Supported via Virtual Memory Management (VMM).
* **AMD (ROCm)**: Fully supported with physical page de-mapping.
* **Intel XPU**: Supported via Level Zero memory management.
* **Huawei NPU**: Supported via Ascend memory scavenging.

### Hardware Requirements

* **Memory Considerations**: System RAM must be sufficient to hold offloaded weights during sleep.
* **TP Support**: Tensor Parallel groups synchronize sleep/wake transitions across all workers.

### Quiescing a busy diffusion stage: `pause_generation(mode="keep")`

`sleep()` on a diffusion stage is a worker-level RPC: it offloads memory but does not stop the
stage's scheduler, so a stage that still has queued requests must be made quiet first. Aborting
discards the batch that is running. `pause_generation(mode="keep")` keeps it instead:

* The batch that is already running finishes on the weights it started with and its outputs are
  delivered normally.
* Requests that have not started stay queued and run after `resume_generation()`, on whatever
  weights are loaded by then. A request never continues denoising across a weight change.
* The call returns only after every replica has acknowledged: the batch that was running has
  finished executing, its asynchronous output copies are done, and the device is synchronized; its
  outputs are then delivered on the normal path. On a non-preemptible backend that acknowledgement
  arrives at the next batch boundary, so expect it to take as long as the remaining batch.
* Control RPCs (`list_loras`, `sleep`, `wake_up`, `resume_generation`) keep working while paused.

Recommended order for a weight update on a diffusion stage:

```python
await engine.pause_generation(mode="keep", clear_cache=False)
await engine.sleep(level=1)          # optional: free memory for the trainer
await engine.wake_up()               # admission stays closed until resume
# install new weights here
await engine.resume_generation()
```

Support matrix and limits:

| Configuration | `mode="keep"` |
| :--- | :--- |
| Request-level execution (`step_execution=False`) with the in-process (`uni`) executor | Supported |
| Request-level execution with the multi-process (`mp`) executor, including asynchronous output | Supported; the acknowledgement waits for the output copies |
| Request-level execution with asynchronous KV prefetch | Supported; the acknowledgement joins any prefetch still in flight |
| Step-level execution (`step_execution=True` / streaming output) | Not supported: the call raises `NotImplementedError` |
| `mode="abort"` / `mode="wait"` / `wait_for_inflight_requests=True` on a diffusion stage | Unchanged: frontend admission is paused only |

Behavior notes:

* Callers that already passed `mode="keep"` for a diffusion stage used to get an immediate return
  that only closed frontend admission. They now also stop the backend and wait for the ACK.
* A timeout or error from `pause_generation` means the pause did **not** complete; the scheduler
  stays closed and the caller must retry the pause or call `resume_generation()` explicitly. Do not
  sleep or mutate weights after a failed pause.
* `resume_generation(stage_ids=...)` that leaves another paused stage closed (an AR stage, or a
  keep-paused diffusion stage) keeps frontend admission closed as well, so new requests cannot
  queue on a stage that will not schedule them. Admission reopens once every stage paused by
  `pause_generation` has been resumed.
* `clear_cache` has no diffusion-specific effect.
* Without a pause call nothing changes: no barrier runs and batching, abort and output ordering are
  as before.

## 2. Usage Examples

### Python API Example

You can programmatically control the lifecycle of stages using the `AsyncOmni` engine.

```python

import asyncio
from vllm_omni.entrypoints.async_omni import AsyncOmni

async def run_sleep_demo():
    # 1. initialization
    engine = AsyncOmni(
        model="ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT",
        enable_sleep_mode=True
    )

    # 2. sleep mode level2
    acks = await engine.sleep(stage_ids=[0], level=2)
    print(f"Freed {acks[0].freed_bytes / 1024**3:.2f} GiB on Stage 0")

    # 3. wake up
    await engine.wake_up(stage_ids=[0])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_sleep_demo())

```

### server command Example

Start the server with sleep mode enabled:

The first method

```

vllm serve ByteDance-Seed/BAGEL-7B-MoT \
--omni \
--enable-sleep-mode \
--trust-remote-code \
--gpu-memory-utilization 0.7

```

The second method

## 3. API Reference

### Methods

| Method | Arguments | Return Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **sleep** | `stage_ids: List[int], level: int` | `List[OmniACK]` | Triggers hibernation for specified stages. Raises `RuntimeError` if a stage fails; the stages stay marked as sleeping, so `wake_up` brings them back, unless a level-2 sleep already discarded weights on some replica. |
| **wake_up** | `stage_ids: List[int]` | `List[OmniACK]` | Reloads weights and re-maps memory. Raises `RuntimeError` if a stage fails; that stage stays sleeping and the call can be retried. |
| **pause_generation** | `mode: str, stage_ids: List[int]` | `None` | Stops admission; with `mode="keep"` also stops diffusion schedulers and returns after their ACK. |
| **resume_generation** | `stage_ids: List[int]` | `None` | Reopens paused schedulers, then admission. |

### OmniACK Dataclass Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **task_id** | `str` | Unique identifier for the operation. |
| **status** | `str` | `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. `sleep` and `wake_up` raise instead of returning an `ERROR` ACK, and `/v1/omni/sleep` and `/v1/omni/wakeup` return HTTP 500 with the error. |
| **stage_id** | `int` | The ID of the stage that responded. |
| **rank** | `int` | The rank ID within the Tensor Parallel group. |
| **freed_bytes** | `int` | Actual amount of physical VRAM reclaimed. |
| **metadata** | `dict` | Additional platform-specific metrics. |

Metadata Field Analysis
The metadata field is a dynamic dictionary containing hardware-specific telemetry and audit data, primarily used for verifying memory reclamation on various backends (e.g., AMD ROCm, NVIDIA CUDA).

```
"metadata": {
    "source": "Platform_AMD_Instinct_MI300X",
    "total_freed_gib": "78.57",
    "rank_residual_gib": "2.07"
}
```

#### Core Utility

**VRAM Reclamation Audit (total_freed_gib)**: Converts raw freed_bytes into human-readable GiB. It serves as the primary metric to verify that Level 2 sleep has successfully purged model weights from VRAM.

**Residual & Fragmentation Monitoring (rank_residual_gib)**: Reports the remaining VRAM footprint after memory de-mapping. A low residual value (e.g., 2.07 GiB) confirms a successful "clean" state, ensuring the device is ready for high-memory co-located tasks like training or diffusion pipelines.

**Backend Traceability (source)**: Identifies the underlying hardware driver or audit source. This is critical for debugging synchronization issues in multi-stage, distributed environments.

**Performance Analytics (Roadmap)**: Future updates will include latency_ms (context-switch overhead) and cuda_graph_recalled (graph engine status) to optimize performance in high-frequency sleep/wake scenarios.
