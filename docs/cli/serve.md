## Multiple API frontends

For local EngineCore pipelines with one or more stages, `--api-server-count` starts
multiple API frontend processes that share one parent-owned set of stage
engines:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --omni \
    --api-server-count 2 \
    --port 8091
```

This mode is intended for workloads whose request parsing, multimodal input
processing, or response encoding can bottleneck a single frontend. It
currently requires local multi-process EngineCore stages with one local
process group per replica. A stage may still use multiple `num_replicas`.
It cannot be combined with diffusion, headless or
remote stages, intra-stage data parallelism, Ray, fault tolerance, elastic
expert parallelism, sleep mode, or runtime LoRA updating. Runtime voice upload
and deletion are also disabled because those mutations are process-local;
built-in voices, inline reference audio, and voices restored at startup remain
available. The `/v1/omni/sleep` and `/v1/omni/wakeup` control routes return HTTP
409 for the same reason: their bookkeeping is process-local while stage engines
are shared.

A single-stage model pipeline is supported through the normal launch command;
this is distinct from the distributed `--stage-id` / `--headless` launch mode.
Every stage in the pipeline must be an EngineCore stage. Mixed AR-to-DiT
pipelines, including MiniMax-H3, remain unsupported even when their first
stage is an EngineCore stage. Diffusion support requires per-frontend channels
and shared-engine lifecycle handling in the diffusion backend.

### Workloads and performance validation

Each API process owns its frontend processor, Orchestrator, request state,
and per-replica EngineCore channels. Requests return through the channel of
the originating API process; model weights and GPU stage engines are shared.
This distributes frontend and orchestration work across CPU processes.

| Workload | Potential benefit | Limitation |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Concurrent cold image/video inputs on supported EngineCore pipelines | Parallel frontend processing when one API process is CPU-limited | A single cold request and GPU computation may be unchanged |
| Many replicas producing frequent text/audio outputs | Less API/Orchestrator work and GIL contention per process | Routing remains serial within each Orchestrator |
| Warm inputs or low-concurrency, GPU-limited generation | Additional frontend capacity | More API processes may add overhead without improving throughput |

Here, a cold input means media or preprocessing caches miss, not that model
weights must be loaded or GPU kernels compiled. Each frontend has its own
processor/cache state, so cache duplication, CPU thread contention, and memory
usage also matter. Multi-API serving does not itself change the output queue,
move response encoding to an executor, or change the model's numerical scheduler.

Compare `--api-server-count 1`, `2`, and higher counts with the same hardware,
model/stage configuration, media, sampling parameters, output lengths, and
offered load. Keep cold-cache and warmed-cache runs separate and report repeated
measurements. Record CPU and request counts for every API worker, input and
output queue delay, GPU utilization, first-output latency, and end-to-end latency.
Confirm requests reach every worker: connection reuse can concentrate traffic
on one process. Queue-only or single-API experiments do not establish a
multi-API throughput gain. The multi-replica workload in
[#4680](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/issues/4680) remains a relevant
validation target.

## Stage-based CLI quickstart

The stage-based CLI is designed for deployments that require launching each pipeline stage in an isolated process
(e.g., across separate operating system processes, distinct GPUs, or distributed hosts).

- For **migrated models** that utilize the bundled deployment YAML configurations located in
  `vllm_omni/deploy/`, the `--deploy-config` flag is only required to override the default configuration. By default, executing `vllm serve MODEL --omni ...`
  automatically loads the bundled deployment configuration.

Example: Initializing Stage 0 (Orchestrator and API Server):
The commands below show a common device mapping where Stage 0 uses GPU 0 and
worker stages use GPU 1 via `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --omni \
    --port 8091 \
    --stage-id 0 \
    --omni-master-address 127.0.0.1 \
    --omni-master-port 26000
```

Example: Initializing a Headless Worker Stage (Stage 1):

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --omni \
    --stage-id 1 \
    --headless \
    --omni-master-address 127.0.0.1 \
    --omni-master-port 26000
```

When utilizing a custom deployment YAML, append `--deploy-config /path/to/override.yaml` to each command execution.

In the standard execution paradigm, the `--stage-overrides` argument is utilized to apply stage-specific configurations from a single CLI command.
However, under the **stage-based CLI** paradigm, where each process strictly encapsulates a single stage, it is recommended to specify tuning parameters directly via discrete command-line flags for the respective stage, rather than constructing a composite `--stage-overrides` JSON string.

For example, as an alternative to the following composite configuration:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --omni --port 8091 \
    --stage-overrides '{"1": {"gpu_memory_utilization": 0.5}}'
```

the stage-based CLI permits the direct initialization of Stage 1 with explicit parameters:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --omni \
    --stage-id 1 \
    --headless \
    --gpu-memory-utilization 0.5 \
    --omni-master-address 127.0.0.1 \
    --omni-master-port 26000
```

Async video jobs use process-local metadata and task handles. With multiple API
workers, creating, listing, retrieving, downloading, and deleting these jobs
returns HTTP 409. This restriction is independent of the current diffusion
stage launch restriction: supporting multi-worker diffusion also requires a
shared job lifecycle. Missing frontend topology state returns HTTP 503 for
operations that require process-local state protection.
